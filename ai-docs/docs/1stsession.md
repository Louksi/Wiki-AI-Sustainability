# Drones for disease prevention and detection

### Pros:

- Lower energy cost: Electric drones cost less to run than oil-powered tractors or vehicles.
- Speed and efficiency: Much faster than manual labor; reduces repetitive, tedious work.
- Automation: Minimal need for human labor for repetitive tasks, freeing workers for specialized work.
- Precision farming: Detects plant diseases, pests, or irrigation issues quickly and accurately.
- Access to remote areas: Reach difficult or hazardous terrain where machinery or humans struggle.
- Data integration: Can work with laboratories or software systems for real-time data analysis.
- Scalability: Useful for large-scale farming with repetitive tasks like spraying or mapping.
- Time savings: Can operate continuously (24/7) under the right conditions.
- Low error margin: Automated systems reduce human error when well-calibrated.
- Potentially lower maintenance costs compared to heavy machinery like tractors.

### Cons:

- Job displacement: Reduced need for manual labor may raise ethical and economic concerns.
- Limited range: Battery life, payload capacity, and control range can restrict coverage for very large farms.
- Weather dependence: Rain, wind, or storms can halt operations completely.
- High initial costs: Purchase, training, and software subscriptions can be expensive.
- Specialization limits: AI systems may detect only specific diseases or conditions, while humans can assess more broadly.
- Maintenance and downtime: Drones require specialized parts, calibration, and software updates.
- Data and privacy issues: Images and collected data could raise legal concerns on private property.
- System vulnerabilities: Risk of hacking or system failures affecting safety and reliability.
- Responsibility in case of accidents: Liability for crashes, crop damage, or misuse can be unclear (farmer vs. manufacturer).
- Adaptability limits: AI may struggle with evolving diseases or unexpected environmental factors.


### Risks:

- System vulnerabilities
- Data and privacy issues
- Unnecessary destruction of production if error occurs

### Benefits: 

- Low error margin
- Access to remote areas
- Data integration

### Regulation:

Restricted authorizations: Spatial (predefined areas), Data (footage, limit the access)
Maybe restrict how many one can own, depending on the need (type of crops, surface to cover, risk of diseases)

### Directly concerned:

- Scientists / Researchers
- Farmers
- Industries (build drones, train AI)

### Indirectly concerned:

Populations who live close to areas where the drones are deployed
Population who buy products (the cost of those products might change)
Some employees might lose their job
Local fauna and flora.


### AI is used in:

Check which plot needs treatment
Distinguish between sick and healthy crops
Distinguish between different types of crops, to administer specific treatments, different treatments depending on which type of crop needs it.
