## 1. What machine learning methods can be used?


Several machine learning techniques are applicable to drone-based crop disease detection and treatment. The most common approach is supervised learning, where models are trained on labeled images of healthy and diseased crops to classify new samples. Algorithms such as Random Forests or Support Vector Machines are often used for this purpose. More advanced methods rely on deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can automatically learn relevant visual features from images captured by RGB, multispectral, or hyperspectral cameras. Architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet, or U-Net are frequently employed for classification, segmentation, or object detection tasks. When labeled data is unavailable, unsupervised learning methods such as clustering or dimensionality reduction (for example, k-Means or PCA) can help detect anomalies or unusual vegetation patterns. In some cases, reinforcement learning is also used to optimize drone navigation and flight paths, improving coverage efficiency and reducing energy consumption.

## 2. What equipment or infrastructure is needed?

The hardware and infrastructure required to implement these systems combine aerial, computational, and software components. Drones such as quadcopters, hexacopters, or fixed-wing models are equipped with imaging sensors, including RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, or LiDAR cameras, as well as GPS modules for precise geolocation. When treatment is automated, spraying mechanisms may also be integrated. Data is collected and managed through a ground control station that plans flights and receives telemetry information. For processing, drones can rely on onboard edge devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson modules, to perform real-time inference. Larger analyses, including model training and post-flight processing, are executed on local servers or cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. The software stack typically involves image and data processing tools like OpenCV, GDAL, or QGIS, and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn.

# 3. What kind of data is used, and how is it managed?

The data used in these applications mainly consists of images acquired by the drones-RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, or thermal-along with metadata describing the GPS position, altitude, and weather conditions during each capture. The volume of data can be significant, often reaching several tens or hundreds of gigabytes per flight depending on image resolution and area covered. Most of the data is collected specifically for the target fields, although existing public datasets like PlantVillage may occasionally be reused to pre-train models. In general, the collected data remains private and belongs to the farmer, research institution, or agricultural company operating the drones. Access is restricted to authorized users such as data scientists or agronomists. Because agricultural data can reveal sensitive information, such as crop health or yield potential, strict data protection measures are applied, including encryption during transfer, anonymization of identifiable information, and restricted access control. Finally, the data is stored either on local servers for immediate analysis or in cloud-based storage systems for scalability and long-term archiving, with structured databases like PostgreSQL often used to manage spatial information efficiently.
