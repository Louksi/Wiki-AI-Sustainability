## 1. Do companies provide environmental reports? Can you find GHG emission analysis from companies?

We didn’t find any specific figures on the environmental impact of drones in agriculture given by companies. There is no information on GHG emissions, water usage, or electricity consumption during the manufacture or use of these machines.
The reports (where they exist) focus on the impact of these technologies on agriculture.

As an example, we will examine the 2024-2025 report provided by DJI Agriculture **[5][6]** (the only company report we were able to find).
DJI claims that their drones have saved 222 million tons of water and reduced carbon emissions by 30.87 million tons of CO₂. However, no context is provided, we do not know the time frame over which these figures are calculated, nor do we have previous values to make an informed comparison (**Introduction [5]**).
The report follows with studies of regulations in different countries and practical cases.
For example, in **section 4.3 - Orchard Management [5]**, the report indicates the savings made through the use of drones: applying pesticides by drone reduces the amount of pesticides used by more than 50%. Instead of taking several days, the application can be done in a few hours (2.5 hours), and labour costs are significantly reduced: from 320 euros to 80 euros. In general, this represents a reduction of up to 70% in pesticide application costs.
This illustrates how drones can help reduce the amount of water used, as well as the share of GHG reduction, when using these drones.
However, there is no mention of the cost of the machine: maintenance, battery and charging, AI training when integrated. There are only indications on certain drone models, such as the speed, and at what height and what distance from each other the drones should be for optimal spraying.
We also don’t have any indication on the costs for manufacturing, transport, and end-of-life, nor their associated environmental impacts.

Other reports, such as **‘Environmental assessment of digitalisation in agriculture: A systematic review’ - HAL Open Science [7]**, and **‘Environmental impact of agricultural sprayers used in Japanese rice farming’ -  International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability [8]**, provide more information about the carbon and water impact of the technologies used. However, these articles are not environmental reports, nor specific to any company.
The first one is a report on the life cycle of digital agriculture technologies on several levels, and the second is a report on the life cycle of automatic irrigation options: boom spraying or UAV sprayers (a comparison of ground or aerial irrigation) on two farms.

The first report highlights the use of eco-friendly materials to replace materials made of metal in order to reduce GHG emissions and the use of mineral resources (**5.2 - Considering DAT as emerging technologies [7]**).
It also mentions international standards put in place to reduce GHG emissions, such as the 2016 Framework Convention on Climate Change (**5.5 - Implications of the research for decision-making [7]**), and standard methods used by companies to track their water footprint (**2.2 - Analysing the selected studies [7]**).

The second report is specific about the technologies used, discussing the electricity used by aerial techniques and comparing them to ground techniques, indicating which energy is used by which technique (**Life-cycle inventory (LCI)**, and **Table 3. Life cycle inventory for Farm H and Farm K [8]**).
They also studied water consumption of all techniques (**Table 3. Life cycle inventory for Farm H and Farm K**, **Results and discussion**, and **Table 5. LCIA results of pest-control operation using boom spraying, power spraying, and UAV treatment [8]**).
The overall conclusion is that aerial methods have a reduced environmental impact compared to ground-based methods, but that it depends heavily on the size of the area over which the drones are deployed.

## 2. Who are the stakeholders (funders, users, companies, researchers, distributors, law, associations, federations, local authorities, etc.) involved in the development and deployment of the AI system?

In the case of stakesholder, its quite difficult to find all actors, but we can find in the **Transforming Farming: A Review of AI-Powered UAV Technologies in Precision Agriculture[9]** it will show a workflow for integration of UAVs,sensors, and AI in precision farming. For the sake of the quantity of actors, we will show it under tables.

For the companies, there is a lot of actors such as :


|Category | Company| product| Description | 
| ---| ------------- | ------------- | --- |
|AI-driven seeding and spraying drone| XAG | P100 agricultural drone | AI-powered UAV designed for precision seeding and spraying in agriculture |
| AI-enhanced smart irrigation| Netafim | Net | AI-based irrigation system that optimizes water usage based on real-time data |
|Soil and plant stress monitoring UAV | CropX || AI-based platform for soil and crop monitoring, integrating sensors for plant health detection.
|Soil health monitoring system| Arable mark 2 || Solar-Powered sensor that tracks soil moisture,temperature, and plant health metrics|


For the customers of these solution we found in the [cropx website](https://cropx.com/) have actors such as Greenway,Reinke,Sumitomo corporation pepsico,dairy holdings limited.
Also for these company they have a distribution network around the globe.

In case of law and federation, the most company are based in USA so we will use USA law andfederation. First, there is the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/small-unmanned-aircraft-systems-uas-regulations-part-107) (Federal Aviation Administration) who state laws for commercial use of the drone, Certificate and Airspace Authorizations.

## 3. What arguments are used by stakeholders to promote or, on the contrary, discourage the solution?
