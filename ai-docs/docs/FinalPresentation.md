Objective:
UAV are use for disease diagnosis, prevention and target treatment. That helps farmer with better organization : reduce hours, and optimization : local application of pesticides on specific crops that have diseases.

Technologies used are very precise: different types of cameras, with LiDAR, thermal, and hyperspectral

Pros:

Cons:

### Pros:

- Lower energy cost: Electric drones cost less to run than oil-powered tractors or vehicles.
> emy

- Speed and efficiency: Much faster than manual labor; reduces repetitive, tedious work.
> Drones such as quadcopters, hexacopters, or fixed-wing models are equipped with imaging sensors, including RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, or LiDAR cameras, as well as GPS modules for precise geolocation.

- Automation: Minimal need for human labor for repetitive tasks, freeing workers for specialized work.

- Precision farming: Detects plant diseases, pests, or irrigation issues quickly and accurately.
> “Based on the segmented areas of the fruit tree canopies, the volume of pesticide spraying was calculated and a prescription map was constructed, reducing pesticide usage by 47.92% compared to direct spraying.” - YOLO-FI [2]

- Access to remote areas: Reach difficult or hazardous terrain where machinery or humans struggle.
- Data integration: Can work with laboratories or software systems for real-time data analysis.
- Scalability: Useful for large-scale farming with repetitive tasks like spraying or mapping.
- Time savings: Can operate continuously (24/7) under the right conditions.
- Low error margin: Automated systems reduce human error when well-calibrated.
- Potentially lower maintenance costs compared to heavy machinery like tractors.

### Cons:

- Difficult to optimize water consumption, and high water consumption
> [9]

- Job displacement: Reduced need for manual labor may raise ethical and economic concerns.

- Limited range: Battery life, payload capacity, and control range can restrict coverage for very large farms.
>

- Weather dependence: Rain, wind, or storms can halt operations completely.

- High initial costs: Purchase, training, and software subscriptions can be expensive.

- Specialization limits: AI systems may detect only specific diseases or conditions, while humans can assess more broadly.

- Maintenance and downtime: Drones require specialized parts, calibration, and software updates.

- Data and privacy issues: Images and collected data could raise legal concerns on private property.

- System vulnerabilities: Risk of hacking or system failures affecting safety and reliability.

- Responsibility in case of accidents: Liability for crashes, crop damage, or misuse can be unclear (farmer vs. manufacturer).

- Adaptability limits: AI may struggle with evolving diseases or unexpected environmental factors.
