Objective:
UAV are use for disease diagnosis, prevention and target treatment. That helps farmer with better organization : reduce hours, and optimization : local application of pesticides on specific crops that have diseases.

Technologies used are very precise: different types of cameras, with LiDAR, thermal, and hyperspectral

Pros:

Cons:

-intro/summary
Our project is about UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) used for disease diagnosis, prevention and target treatment of crops.<br>

Our first impression was mixed, we had a lot of preconceptions that we then tried to verify or refute on several topics. Such initial ideas were related to several topics, such as the energy used to power the drone, how such a technology could help a farmer, or the use of AI in this domain.<br>

We reserached existing solutions, who made them, with which technologies, and for what purpose.<br>
Then we discussed the use of AI in drones like that. How the data is processed and where it comes from.<br>
We looked up information on the energy consumption of existing drones, and studied two different reports on LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) of UAVs used in farming.<br>
And finally we tried to gather information on the impact of manufacturing such technologies, and what is said by stakeholders on the use of UAVs in this context.<br>

We had a hard time finding reports from companies. Unfortunately, the one we did find did not have any information on GHG emissions, water usage, or energy consumption during the manufacture, or use of those technologies. The report from DJI Agriculture [5] focuses on the impact of their products on farming. However, they do not discuss the impact of AI, nor the cost of drones over traditional methods.<br>
While we didn’t find any specific figures on the environmental impact of drones in agriculture given by companies, there are some reports that study LCA of such drones.<br>
They rarely give precise numbers, but we understand through a comparison between ground-based techniques and UAVs [8], that drones generally are less power hungry, they are more efficient and help reduce labor.<br>
The stakeholders agree the UAVs are a technology that helps farmers efficiently, reducing labor, waste (of products and water), and mitigating the environmental impact of farming practices, which leads to cost savings.<br>
However, those specialized drones first come with a price, they need specific infrastructure, maintaining, and good connectivity. This is restricting access to those technologies to organisations that can afford it in the first place.<br>
In addition, stakeholders worry about the use of data collected. Images or videos are taken so they are asking for regulations on data privacy and ownership.

### Pros:

- Lower energy cost: Electric drones cost less to run than oil-powered tractors or vehicles.
> emy

- Speed and efficiency: Much faster than manual labor; reduces repetitive, tedious work.
> Drones such as quadcopters, hexacopters, or fixed-wing models are equipped with imaging sensors, including RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, or LiDAR cameras, as well as GPS modules for precise geolocation.

- Automation: Minimal need for human labor for repetitive tasks, freeing workers for specialized work.

- Precision farming: Detects plant diseases, pests, or irrigation issues quickly and accurately.
> “Based on the segmented areas of the fruit tree canopies, the volume of pesticide spraying was calculated and a prescription map was constructed, reducing pesticide usage by 47.92% compared to direct spraying.” - YOLO-FI [2]

- Access to remote areas: Reach difficult or hazardous terrain where machinery or humans struggle.
- Data integration: Can work with laboratories or software systems for real-time data analysis.
- Scalability: Useful for large-scale farming with repetitive tasks like spraying or mapping.
- Time savings: Can operate continuously (24/7) under the right conditions.
- Low error margin: Automated systems reduce human error when well-calibrated.
- Potentially lower maintenance costs compared to heavy machinery like tractors.

### Cons:

- Difficult to optimize water consumption, and high water consumption
> [9]

- Job displacement: Reduced need for manual labor may raise ethical and economic concerns.

- Limited range: Battery life, payload capacity, and control range can restrict coverage for very large farms.
>

- Weather dependence: Rain, wind, or storms can halt operations completely.

- High initial costs: Purchase, training, and software subscriptions can be expensive.

- Specialization limits: AI systems may detect only specific diseases or conditions, while humans can assess more broadly.

- Maintenance and downtime: Drones require specialized parts, calibration, and software updates.

- Data and privacy issues: Images and collected data could raise legal concerns on private property.

- System vulnerabilities: Risk of hacking or system failures affecting safety and reliability.

- Responsibility in case of accidents: Liability for crashes, crop damage, or misuse can be unclear (farmer vs. manufacturer).

- Adaptability limits: AI may struggle with evolving diseases or unexpected environmental factors.
